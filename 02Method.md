# **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) Models**

## **1. Waterfall Model**
A **linear and sequential** approach where each phase must be completed before moving to the next.

### **Phases:**
1. **Requirement Analysis**
2. **System Design**
3. **Implementation (Coding)**
4. **Testing**
5. **Deployment**
6. **Maintenance**

### **Advantages:**
- ✅ Simple and easy to manage  
- ✅ Clear documentation and well-defined phases  
- ✅ Best for projects with fixed requirements  

### **Disadvantages:**
- ❌ Not flexible; changes are difficult to accommodate  
- ❌ Late testing phase increases risk of major issues  

**Use Case:** Best for projects with well-defined requirements, such as government and enterprise systems.  

---

## **2. V-Shaped Model (Validation & Verification Model)**
An **extension of the Waterfall model**, but testing is planned in parallel with development.

### **Phases:**
1. **Requirement Analysis** ➝ **Acceptance Testing**  
2. **System Design** ➝ **System Testing**  
3. **Architecture Design** ➝ **Integration Testing**  
4. **Module Design** ➝ **Unit Testing**  
5. **Coding**  

### **Advantages:**
- ✅ Defects are identified early  
- ✅ Works well for projects with clear requirements  

### **Disadvantages:**
- ❌ Rigid and lacks flexibility  
- ❌ Not ideal for complex or evolving projects  

**Use Case:** Suitable for critical systems like healthcare and aerospace applications.

## **3. Spiral Model**
A **risk-driven** iterative model that combines Waterfall and prototyping, focusing on continuous refinement.

### **Phases (Repeats in Spirals):**
1. **Planning**
2. **Risk Analysis**
3. **Engineering (Development & Testing)**
4. **Evaluation & Review**

### **Advantages:**
- ✅ Handles risks early in the development  
- ✅ Flexibility to change requirements  
- ✅ Good for large, complex projects  

### **Disadvantages:**
- ❌ Expensive and time-consuming  
- ❌ Requires expert risk assessment  

**Use Case:** Ideal for high-risk projects like banking software and large enterprise systems.  

---

## **4. Agile Model**
A **flexible and iterative** approach with continuous feedback and fast delivery.

### **Agile Frameworks:**
- **Scrum** (Sprints & daily standups)  
- **Kanban** (Visual workflow management)  
- **XP (Extreme Programming)** (Continuous testing & development)  

### **Advantages:**
- ✅ Fast delivery and frequent releases  
- ✅ Easy to adapt to changing requirements  
- ✅ Continuous customer collaboration  

### **Disadvantages:**
- ❌ Requires strong team coordination  
- ❌ Not ideal for projects with fixed budgets and deadlines  

**Use Case:** Suitable for startups, web apps, and software with evolving requirements.  

---

## **5. Incremental Model**
The software is developed and delivered in **small parts (increments)**, each adding new functionality.

### **Phases (Repeats for Each Increment):**
1. **Requirement Analysis**
2. **Design**
3. **Implementation**
4. **Testing**
5. **Deployment**

### **Advantages:**
- ✅ Early software delivery with core features  
- ✅ Less risk compared to Waterfall  
- ✅ Easier bug fixes and improvements  

### **Disadvantages:**
- ❌ Requires detailed planning  
- ❌ May need more resources for parallel development  

**Use Case:** Best for applications needing regular updates, like e-commerce platforms.  

---

## **6. Prototype Model**
A **working prototype is created first** to understand requirements better before full development.

### **Phases:**
1. **Requirement Gathering**
2. **Quick Prototype Development**
3. **User Feedback & Refinement**
4. **Development & Deployment**

### **Advantages:**
- ✅ Helps clarify unclear requirements  
- ✅ Early user feedback improves usability  
- ✅ Reduces overall project risk  

### **Disadvantages:**
- ❌ Can increase costs if too many iterations are needed  
- ❌ Not suitable for large projects with well-defined requirements  

**Use Case:** Useful for UI/UX-heavy applications and systems with high user interaction.

| Model             | Flexibility      | Risk Management      | Speed of Delivery       | Best for |
|-------------      |------------      |-----------------     |------------------       |---------|
| **Waterfall**     | Low              | High (Late testing)  | Slow                    | Well-defined projects |
| **V-Shaped**      | Low              | Medium               | Slow                    | Critical systems |
| **Spiral**        | High             | High                 | Medium                  | Large, high-risk projects |
| **Agile**         | Very High        | Medium               | Fast                    | Evolving projects |
| **Incremental**   | Medium           | Medium               | Faster than Waterfall   | Scalable applications |
| **Prototype**     | High             | Medium               | Medium                  | UI/UX-focused projects |

## **Conclusion**
- **Waterfall & V-Model**: Best for structured, fixed-requirement projects.  
- **Spiral & Prototype**: Best for projects with high risk or unclear requirements.  
- **Agile & Incremental**: Best for fast-paced, evolving projects.
